Hello.

To run everything, open a terminal and enter

 >> sage hub.sage

This is a lie.  I ran it in pieces, not all at once, and at some points I used some shell scripts to chop up and reassemble some text files.  those are not included.  The places where I did that are noted in comments in hub.sage.  Also, most of the code in that file is commented by default, and would need to be uncommented to run.
